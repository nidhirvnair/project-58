            <p>Coding is a very easy subject ,some may feel it as difficult at first but will soon feel comfortable with it.Coding is a skill where you take instructions (the steps in a task) and translate it into a language the computer understands since computers do not communicate like humans. They communicate in a language called BINARY and it is uses 0's and 1's. Coders write the instructions using a programming language.I started coding when i was 10 years old or 4th grade`s ending .Even i felt that some times ,but soon it was so easy. To make this website i used brackets.io and did it as a project . Coding is so interesting . It keeps us busy and keep us active thorought out the day </p>
